# dns-resolver-socket-programming

dns_mapping.txt file contains 5 domain names along with their IP Addresses.

- Open a terminal and run python3 server.py.  
- Open another terminal and run python3 client.py

Now, upon running, it will prompt the user for the domain name input. The client will then receive the corresponding transaction ID along with the IP Address.  
The current program supports IPv4 IP Addresses but it can be extended to IPv6 too as illustrated in part 3 of the assignment.

Remember the order of running the python files matters and the server.py should be ran first.
